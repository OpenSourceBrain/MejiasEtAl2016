This is the original Matlab code developed by Jorge Mejias to reproduce several
figures of Mejias et al., [Science Advances](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/11/e1601335), e1601335, 2016.

The code is also available on [ModelDb](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/showmodel.cshtml?model=249589&file=/Mejias2016/readme.html#tabs-2).

The additional figures provided with the code have not been added to this repo
